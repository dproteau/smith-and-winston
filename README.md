# winston-smith

Winston Smith is a wrapper around Winston aiming to reduce configuration code

The goal of Winston Smith is to provide a logger properly configured to my needs without great ceremony.  With the default configuration, we output to the console string messages (debug level) and write to a flat file json messages (info level).

## Installation
```bash
$ npm install winston-smith
```
