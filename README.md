# smith-and-winston

Smith and Winston is a wrapper around Winston aiming to reduce configuration code

Its goal is to provide a logger properly configured to my needs without great ceremony.  With the default configuration, we output to the console string messages (debug level) and write to a flat file json messages (info level).

## Installation

$ npm install winston-smith
